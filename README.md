# Welcome to CCISS!

[![Lifecycle:Maturing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Maturing-007EC6)](<Redirect-URL>)

This is the main github repo for the CCISS web tool.

## What is CCISS?

Climate Change Informed Species Selection (CCISS – pronounced ‘kiss’) is a Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification-based analysis framework built to anticipate the change climate implications to tree species environmental suitability at a site specific level. The CCISS tool is a web-based application that makes this analysis accessible to practitioners to help guide climate change adaptation in reforestation decisions.

Understanding climate- and site-level species suitability is one of the foundational pieces of information that practitioners require for the creation of silvicultural prescriptions that will lead to successful reforestation over a rotation period. Climate change will affect this goal by progressively altering environmental conditions and therefore the suitability of tree species established on a site over time.

To address this challenge, the CCISS tool projects changes to species environmental suitability at a site series level for any user selected location in the province and estimates the future suitability of a tree species to this changing climate. To account for future climate uncertainty the tool looks at a wide range of global climate change models and emissions scenarios to capture the range of plausible climate futures for any location in BC in 20-year periods out to 2100.

To assist users, the tool compares the current species selection guidance in the Chief Foresters Reference Guide with the future forecast from the CCISS analysis. Reports from the tool highlight where currently acceptable species are stable/improving or declining/unsuitable and where new species have become suitable and could be considered as candidates for assisted migration.

## Repository structure

#### R packages folders

#### Special

##### .gitignore
Tells git which files to ignore.
See [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

##### .Rbuildignore
Tells R which files to ignore when it builds the package.
See [Writing R extension](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#index-_002eRbuildignore-file).

##### .github
Github actions workflows.
 - Package checks (R-CMD-check)
 - Online documentation (pkgdown),
 - Tests coverages report (test-coverage)
 - Style code / run roxygen2 (pr-commands)
You can read more about actions from [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions)

Workflows are setup or updated with the following instruction.

```r
usethis::use_tidy_github_actions()
```
Custom modifications made.  
 - Reduce the number of target for R CMD check.

To disable a workflow,
go the github actions tab, select a workflow, click on the ... dots on the right
and select disable workflow.
