<h2>Tree species feasibility report</h2>
<p>This is the main report of the CCISS tool. The Summary mode of this
report provides a comparison of the Chief Forester’s Reference Guide for
Stocking Standards (CFRG) and the CCISS feasibility assessment. The
Detailed mode shows the distribution of feasibility ratings for the
global climate model ensemble in each time period.</p>
<p>The concept and definitions of CCISS feasibility ratings are
discussed in more detail
<a href="3c_FeasibilityRatings.html">here</a>.</p>
<div id="selectionfilter-pane" class="section level3">
<h3>Selection/Filter pane</h3>
<p>In the left pane select the BGC subzone/variant and then the site
series of interest. The edatopic space of the selected site series is
displayed in the graphic below for reference. By default the report will
show all species that are predicted to be feasible in at least one model
and time period. Choose the “Feasible Only” option to limit the list to
species that meet the threshold for classification as feasible across
the global climate model ensemble in any of the time periods.</p>
</div>
<div id="detailed-report" class="section level3">
<h3>Detailed report</h3>
<p>This report shows modelled feasibility ratios for each species in the
selected site series for each time period. The colour legend for
feasibility ratings is on the left hand pane. The mapped biogeoclimatic
unit represents the historical equilibrium climate approximated by the
climatic conditions of the 1961-1990 period. The recent time period
(2001-2020) has two bars: one for the observed climate (measured by
weather stations), and one for the climates simulated by the ensemble of
global climate models. These two bars aren’t necessarily expected to
agree: The modelled climates sample a large range of possible recent
conditions, of which the observed recent climate is only one.</p>
<p>The report then summarizes the baseline suitability ratings and
forecasted feasibility ratings for each species in the following
order:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <strong>CFRG suitability</strong> rating: Suitability ratings
taken directly from the Chief foresters reference guide</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>CFRG P/A</strong> value: Preferred/Acceptable ratings
taken directly from the Chief foresters reference guide</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Historical Environmental Suitability</strong>: Expert
baseline environmental suitability rating for site series.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CCISS Establishment Feasibility</strong>: The feasibility
rating based on the baseline (1961-1990), recent observed (2001-2020),
and 2021-2040 future projected feasibilities. This indicates the likely
level of constraints for successful establishment of the species in the
present climate. Default model settings equally weight time
periods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CCISS Maturation Feasibility</strong>: The mean
feasibility rating across the 20-year normal periods (2021-2100). This
indicates the inferred feasibility of successfully growing an
established to maturity (80 years). Default model settings equally
weight time periods</p></li>
<li><p><strong>P/A</strong>: Assessed preferred/acceptable rating based
on establishment and maturation feasibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trend</strong>: the proportion of the GCM simulations
indicating improving/stable feasibility (numerator) vs. declining
feasibility or remaining unfeasible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The weights used to calculate Establishment Feasibility and
Maturation Feasibility can be modified using the “Adjust Parameters”
dialog box in the “Select Sites” tab.</p>
<div id="novel-climates" class="section level4">
<h4>Novel climates</h4>
<p>Climatic novelty refers to the degree of mismatch between a future
climate condition and the biogeoclimatic analog it is classified as.
Valid inferences of species suitability are not possible in highly novel
climates. By default, biogeoclimatic projections with high (5<span class="math inline"><em>σ</em></span>) novelty are removed from CCISS
results and replaced with a black bar in the detailed feasibility
results. Removal of novel climates can be disabled or adjusted using the
“Adjust Parameters” dialog box in the “Select Sites” tab. See
Documentation - Methods - Novel Climates for more details.</p>

<div id="summary-report" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary report</h3>
<p>This report compares CCISS maturation feasibility with the Chief
Forester’s Reference Guide for Stocking Standards. Species codes are
coloured according to trends in their future feasibility using the
legend at the bottom of the selection pane: improving (green),
decreasing (red). Species added to the CCISS stocking standard are
coloured purple, and species dropped from the CCISS stocking standard
are strike-through.</p>
