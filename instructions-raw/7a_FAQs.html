<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<div id="if-the-climate-model-ensemble-mean-is-different-than-the-historical-climate-does-this-mean-the-climate-models-are-wrong" class="section level4">
<h4>If the climate model ensemble mean is different than the historical
climate, does this mean the climate models are wrong?</h4>
<p>The historical climate is one observation of many possible climate
states that could have occurred due to the internal variability
(weather) of the Earth’s climate system. Differences between the
ensemble mean projection and the observed climate are not necessarily a
contradiction; like climate vs. weather, the ensemble mean is the
expectation and the observed climate is what actually happened.</p>
<p>However, if the observed climate is completely outside the range of
the individual model runs, this is a problem. There are two major
reasons why this could occur: (1) the downscaled model ensemble is
failing to capture some aspect of regional climate dynamics; or (2) the
observations themselves are biased due to errors in the station
observations or in the gridded interpolation between stations. Both of
these potential sources of error are an active area of research by the
CCISS team.</p>
</div>
<div id="does-the-cciss-tool-account-for-forest-health-factors" class="section level4">
<h4>Does the CCISS tool account for forest health factors?</h4>
<p>No. The role of forest health factors is explicitly excluded from the
CCISS environmental suitability ratings, with the intention that they
are a separate layer of information in reforestation decisions. CCISS is
one modeling methodology that considers climate change implications for
tree species suitability. Ultimately decisions on species selection
should be made using multiple lines of evidence, including insects and
disease.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-does-the-cciss-model-promote-or-demote-certain-species" class="section level4">
<h4>Why does the CCISS model promote or demote certain species?</h4>
<p>The species projected suitability ratings are based on environmental
suitability assigned to a BGC subzone-variant. The CCISS model selects
BGCs that match the future climate projections for the point(s) or BGC
of interest. Future species suitability projections are then pulled from
the BGCs projected for that point or area. Go to the “BEC futures” tab
to see the breakdown of which BGCs are projected.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-the-climate-drivers-of-species-suitability-trends" class="section level4">
<h4>What are the climate drivers of species suitability trends?</h4>
<p>This functionality does not currently exist in the CCISS tool. We are
planning to include a climate component in CCISS spatial in the
future.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-do-c4-b2-and-d6-refer-to-in-the-cciss-spatial-module-and-why-does-snr-come-first" class="section level4">
<h4>What do C4, B2 and D6 refer to in the CCISS Spatial Module? And why
does SNR come first?</h4>
<p>These are soil nutrient regime (SNR)/ soil moisture regime (SMR)
edatopes, indicating poor/subxeric (B2), mesic/medium (C4) and
rich/hygric (D6) site types across all BGCs. Providing spatial data for
all 35 edatopes would be too computationally feasible, so we chose these
three edatopes to represent distinct, common site types. Although it is
typical to place SMR first in edatope names (e.g., 4C), we put SNR first
because it is much more convenient in computer code.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-uncertainty-around-the-current-suitability-ratings-for-the-modeled-us-bec-units" class="section level4">
<h4>What is the uncertainty around the current suitability ratings for
the modeled US BEC units?</h4>
<p>There is no equivalent, published biogeoclimatic ecosystem
classification and mapping for the United States. We used a draft
classification of biogeoclimatic units for Washington, Idaho, Montana,
Oregon, northern California, and northwestern Wyoming to provide
potential future climate analogues for British Columbia (MacKenzie &amp;
Mahony 2021). Site series classification was developed and species
suitability ratings were assigned by an expert ecologist based on veg
plot data.</p>
<p>There is a higher level of uncertainty associated with the US
biogeoclimatic classification. The draft site series classification for
US BGC units is generic and broader (i.e. larger edatopic range) than
BC, consequently there is less specificity on tree species suitability.
Additionally, biogeoclimatic units are at the subzone level, and in some
cases are climatically more diverse than BC units which are at the
subzone-variant level. However, the inclusion of these draft US BGC
units results in much reduced uncertainty compared to their absence. The
analogs for future climate in much of southern BC are located across the
border in the US.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-projection-and-a-prediction" class="section level4">
<h4>What is the difference between a projection and a prediction?</h4>
<p>“Projection”, “prediction”, and “forecast” are related terms with
varying usage in ecology and climate science. For the purposes of CCISS
we use the following definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Forecast</strong>—A forecast is an estimate of possible
future states of a variable of interest. A forecast is not a “crystal
ball” of what will happen, but a quantification of uncertainty in what
could happen. Providing forecasts of environmental suitability for tree
species is the ultimate goal of CCISS. CCISS forecasts are a synthesis
of many projections of tree species suitability that have been carefully
selected to provide a meaningful representation of uncertainty.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Projection</strong>—A projection is an estimate of the
change over time in a variable of interest given a specific set of
assumptions. CCISS provides one projection of tree species suitability
for each of three simulations of eight global climate models following
three atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration scenarios. The 2001-2020
period of these simulations is considered a projection even though it
occurs in the past.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prediction</strong>—In CCISS, the term prediction is used
exclusively as model prediction: the process by which a statistical
model estimates a response variable (i.e., biogeoclimatic
subzone/variant analog) based on predictor variables (i.e., climate
variables). A model prediction can be made for any values of the
predictor variables regardless of whether they represent past, future,
or hypothetical conditions. Each biogeoclimatic projection for one
20-year time period is a model prediction.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="why-doesnt-the-us-bec-match-up-with-bc-bec-across-the-border" class="section level4">
<h4>Why doesn’t the US BEC match up with BC BEC across the border?</h4>
<p>We are currently integrating updated BEC classification and mapping
for BEC13 (coast region – LMH77). With new BEC, we are also updating
mapping of US BEC and are working to align biogeoclimatic mapping across
the US – Canada border.</p>
