<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><strong>If the climate model ensemble mean is different than the
historical climate, does this mean the climate models are
wrong?</strong></p>
<p>The historical climate is one observation of many possible climate
states that could have occurred due to the internal variability
(weather) of the Earth’s climate system. Differences between the
ensemble mean projection and the observed climate are not necessarily a
contradiction; like climate vs. weather, the ensemble mean is the
expectation and the observed climate is what actually happened.</p>
<p>However, if the observed climate is completely outside the range of
the individual model runs, this is a problem. There are two major
reasons why this could occur: (1) the downscaled model ensemble is
failing to capture some aspect of regional climate dynamics; or (2) the
observations themselves are biased due to errors in the station
observations or in the gridded interpolation between stations. Both of
these potential sources of error are an active area of research by the
CCISS team.</p>
