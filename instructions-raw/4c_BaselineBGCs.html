<h3>BGC mapping as a baseline</h3>
<p>CCISS results assess change in species suitability relative to the
official biogeoclimatic mapping, rather than the baseline prediction of
the biogeoclimatic model. This approach breaks a standard practice of
climate impacts modeling: Change in a modeled quantity should be
assessed against a modeled baseline. We have taken this approach to
simplify interpretation of CCISS results. Our rationale is explained
below.</p>
<p>Biogeoclimatic models are trained on biogeoclimatic mapping (the
response variable) and 1961-1990 climate normals (the predictor
variables) for a sample of locations. When the model is then used to
predict the biogeoclimatic unit from 1961-1990 climate normals, this is
called a <em>baseline prediction</em>. Baseline predictions do not
perfectly reproduce the original biogeoclimatic mapping because of
imperfections in the biogeoclimatic model, biogeoclimatic mapping, and
climate mapping. Biogeoclimatic models typically have baseline
prediction error of ~20%, meaning that the baseline biogeoclimatic
prediction is different than the official biogeoclimatic subzone/variant
mapping on about 20% of the landscape. In many cases where these
differences occur, the predicted unit is closely related to the mapped
unit and there is negligible consequence for tree species suitability
inferences.</p>
<p>Baseline predictions are the technically correct point of comparison
for biogeoclimatic projections of recent or future climates. If the
mapped biogeoclimatic unit is used as a baseline, there is the potential
to confuse model error with an actual change in climate. This conflation
of model error with real changes causes overestimation of biogeoclimatic
turn-over, but it can produce underestimation or overestimation of
changes in species suitability. The impact of this conflation will be
greatest in the recent period (2001-2020) since the magnitude of
prediction error relative to climate change decreases over time.</p>
<p>Even though a modeled baseline prediction is strictly more correct,
we have chosen to use the official biogeoclimatic mapping as the
baseline for CCISS results. The benefit of this approach is that the
starting point for users will be the expected biogeoclimatic unit and
species suitability ratings of their locations of interest. The
alternative–using the modeled baseline prediction–would in some cases
produce a baseline biogeoclimatic unit that is different than the
biogeoclimatic unit of interest. This would not be tenable for core
CCISS end uses such as silviculture prescriptions and stocking standards
development.</p>
<p>Given that the mapped and predicted baseline BGC unit are different
on &lt;20% of most landscapes, and that these differences are
inconsequential for species suitability interpretations in many cases,
the practical impact of this approach is likely not large. Nevertheless,
we have not yet assessed this issue quantitatively. Users are encouraged
to use the CCISS spatial module to assess baseline prediction errors for
locations of critical interest and to consider the implications for
species suitability interpretations.</p>
