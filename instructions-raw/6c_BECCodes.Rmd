## Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) Codes: 

Full lists of biogeoclimatic units and site series available <a href="https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hre/becweb/resources/codes-standards/standards-becdb.html#intro" target="_blank">here</a>. 

Each biogeoclimatic unit (subzone/variant) is named with a combination of a biogeoclimatic zone (Table 1), a subzone code for precipitation and temperature (Table 2). Sometimes, a modifier for continentality (Table 2) and variant are also necessary. Variants are numeric designations that refer to adjacent biogeoclimatic subzones at different locations in the province. Numbers are assigned in a south-to-north fashion. For example, consider the ICHmc1 unit. The ICH indicates that the unit is in the Interior Cedar - Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone (Table 1). The *m* indicates that the precipitation is *moist*, and the *c* indicates that the temperature is *cold*. Several discrete areas (i.e., variants) in the province fall into the ICHmc biogeoclimatic subzone, so the 1 represents the Nass regional variant of ICHmc.
