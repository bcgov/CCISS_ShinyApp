### Space-for-time substitution

The CCISS analysis is a space-for-time substitution: it uses observations of tree species' tolerances across spatial gradients in climate to infer each species' response to future climate changes. In other words, to understand tree species suitability in a hotter future at any location, we study tree species suitability in warmer places (climate analogs downhill and to the south). The space-for-time substitution approach is useful and necessary; the alternative would be physiological modeling of each tree species, a process with its own assumptions, sources of error, and data limitations. Nevertheless, there are limitations to the space-for-time substitution approach. This approach assumes that spatial differences in environmental conditions mirror the temporal changes expected under climate change, with the added assumption that tree responses to these conditions are consistent across both space and time. The errors associated with violations of these assumptions will vary depending on the species, site, region and silvicultural system.
