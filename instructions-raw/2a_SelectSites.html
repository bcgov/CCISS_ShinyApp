<h2>Select points or areas of interest</h2>
<div id="step-1.-select-points-or-areas-of-interest-using-one-of-three-methods" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Step 1.</strong> Select points or areas of interest using
<strong>one of three methods</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Option 1</strong>. Click on BGC map to add one or more
individual locations. Use this option if you have specific sites you are
interested in or are exploring CCISS results. Where multiple sites are
selected, the user can choose to generate a report where points are
averaged within a BGC (default) or for each individual site.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Option 2</strong>. Click on map to choose an entire BGC
or a BGC within a single Forest District. The CCISS tool will use a set
of pre-selected random points for the units chosen. This option is to be
used where general trends are desired by area. The BGC + District option
is probably most appropriate for stocking standard revisions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Option 3</strong>. User selects a formatted CSV file to
upload user-specified and named points. The batch file must be in
comma-separated (.csv) text format specifying a short sitename,
latitude, longitude, and (optionally) site series (Formatted like
ICHmc2/01a with no spaces) for each site. Batch files of up to 4000
points are supported and run at about 20 points/second.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Step 2</strong>. Optionally change to report by individual
point or average across all points in the same BGC.</h3>
<p>Option 1 and 2 default to BGC averaged reports while option 3
defaults to individual reports.</p>

<div id="adjust-session-parameters-optional" class="section level2">
<h2>Adjust Session Parameters (Optional)</h2>
<p>This dialog box allows users to view and adjust the default settings
of the CCISS tool. Users are encouraged to read the relevant sections of
the CCISS tool documentation prior to changing the default settings.</p>
<div id="climatic-novelty" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Climatic novelty</h3>
<p>Climatic novelty refers to the degree of mismatch between a future
climate condition and the biogeoclimatic analog it is classified as.
Valid inferences of species suitability are not possible in highly novel
climates. By default, biogeoclimatic projections with high (5<span class="math inline"><em>σ</em></span>) novelty are removed from CCISS
results and replaced with a black bar in the detailed feasibility
results. Removal of novel climates can be disabled, and the 5<span class="math inline"><em>σ</em></span> threshold can be adjusted. See
Documentation - Methods - Novel Climates.</p>
</div>
<div id="outside-of-home-range-ohr-suitabilities" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Outside of Home Range (OHR) suitabilities</h3>
<p>CCISS includes environmental suitability ratings for Douglas-fir and
western larch in biogeoclimatic subzone-variants where there is strong
evidence that they were suitable for the baseline 1961-1990 climate
despite not occuring there naturally due to migration lag. The inclusion
of OHR suitabilities can be disabled. See Documentation - Methods -
OHR.</p>
</div>
<div id="establishment-feasibility-weights" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Establishment feasibility weights</h3>
<p>The Feasibility Report provides an assessment of
<strong>establishment feasibility</strong>, representing the likelihood
of success in establishing the species to free growing if planted in the
present climate. This value is a weighted average of the environmental
feasibility in the baseline 1961-1990, observed 2001-2020, and projected
2021-2040 periods. The default weightings are even across these periods
to reflect three perspectives on feasibility. First, the 1961-1990
period reflects the proven viability of the species in the ecosystem.
Second, the observed 2001-2020 period reflects the actual climate
experienced in the location of interest. Third, the projected 2021=2040
period is the expected climate during the establishment of the species.
Users may want to adjust the establishment feasibility weights based on
whether they want a more historically-oriented or future-oriented
assessment. Note that the feasibility in each of these periods is
visible in the detailed feasibility report. See Documentation - Methods
- Rule Sets.</p>
</div>
<div id="maturation-feasibility-weights" class="section level3">
<h3>4. Maturation feasibility weights</h3>
<p>The Feasibility Report provides an assessment of <strong>maturation
feasibility</strong>: the feasibility of the species through the entire
future period to rotation (2021 to 2100). The default setting equally
weights the four 20-year future time periods. See Documentation -
Methods - Rule Sets.</p>
</div>
<div id="gcm-weights" class="section level3">
<h3>5. GCM weights</h3>
<p>There are 13 global climate models available in the CCISS tool.
However, the CCISS tool defaults to the 8-model ensemble of global
climate models recommended by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.7566">Mahony et al. (2022)</a> and
assigns each of these models equal weighting. The five models were
excluded because their warming rates aren’t supported by observational
evidence (CanESM5, UKESM1, INM-CM5; explained <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nrs-climate-change/climatena_8modelrationale.pdf">here</a>),
because they only have a single run for each scenario (BCC-CSM2,
INM-CM5), or because they exhibit unrealistic localized warming in BC
(IPSL-CM6A). See Documentation - Methods - Climate Change
Projections.</p>
</div>
<div id="scenario-weights" class="section level3">
<h3>6. Scenario weights</h3>
<p>Global climate model projections follow scenarios of future
greenhouse gas emissions called <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change">Shared
Socioeconomic Pathways</a> (SSPs). The CCISS tool provides the option of
giving different weights to the four major SSP scenarios: SSP1-2.6,
SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. Collectively, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and
SSP3-7.0 provide a reasonable representation of optimistic, neutral, and
pessimistic outlooks on global emissions policies and socioeconomic
development. The CCISS tool defaults to equal weighting of these three
scenarios to represent scenario uncertainty in climate change
projections. We have set SSP5-8.5 weighting to 0 in the default
scenarios because it is extremely unlikely based on current trends in
energy economics and policy (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00177-3">Hausfather and
Peters 2020</a>). See Documentation - Methods - Climate Change
Projections.</p>
