<h2>Tree species suitability report</h2>
<p>This is the main report of the CCISS tool. The
<strong>Summary</strong> mode of this report provides a comparison of
the Chief Forester’s Reference Guide (CFRG), the environmental
suitability rating (expert derived) and the CCISS suitability assessment
at establishment and maturity. The <strong>Detailed</strong> mode shows
the distribution of suitability ratings for the global climate model
(GCM) ensemble in each time period.</p>
<p>The concept and definitions of environmental suitability ratings and
their relationship to stocking standards (according to the CFRG) and
CCISS model projections are discussed in more detail
<a href="3c_SuitabilityRatings.html">here</a>.</p>
<div id="selectionfilter-pane" class="section level3">
<h3>Selection/Filter pane</h3>
<p>In the left pane, select the BGC subzone/variant and then the site
series of interest. The edatopic space of the selected site series is
displayed in the graphic below for reference. By default the report will
show all species that are predicted to be suitable in at least one model
and time period. Choose the “Suitable Only” option to limit the list to
species that meet the threshold for classification as suitable across
the GCM ensemble in any of the time periods.</p>
</div>
<div id="detailed-report" class="section level3">
<h3>Detailed report</h3>
<p>This report shows modelled suitability ratios for each species in the
selected site series for each time period. The colour legend for
suitability ratings is on the left hand pane. The mapped biogeoclimatic
(BGC) unit represents the historical equilibrium climate approximated by
the climatic conditions of the 1961-1990 period. The recent time period
(2001-2020) has two bars: one for the observed climate (measured by
weather stations), and one for the climates simulated by the ensemble of
GCMs. These two bars are not necessarily expected to agree: The modelled
climates sample a large range of possible recent conditions, of which
the observed recent climate is only one.</p>
<p>The report then summarizes the historical suitability ratings and
CCISS projected suitability ratings for each species in the following
order:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <strong>CFRG suitability</strong> rating: Suitability ratings
taken directly from the Chief Forester’s Reference Guide (CFRG)</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>CFRG P/A</strong> value: Preferred/Acceptable ratings
taken directly from the CFRG</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Historical Environmental Suitability</strong>: Expert
derived baseline (1961-1990) environmental suitability rating for site
series.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CCISS Establishment Suitability</strong>: The suitability
rating based on the historical environmental suitability (1961-1990),
and CCISS projected suitability based on recent observed (2001-2020),
and 2021-2040 future projected climates. This indicates the likely level
of constraints for successful establishment of the species in the
present climate. Default model settings give roughly equal weight to the
three time periods, with slightly more weight to the recent (2001+)
periods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CCISS Maturation Suitability</strong>: The mean
suitability rating projected across the four 20-year normal periods
(2021-2100). This indicates the inferred suitability of successfully
growing an established species to maturity (80 years). Default model
settings equally weight all time periods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>P/A</strong>: CCISS model assessed Preferred/Acceptable
rating based on establishment and maturation suitability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trend</strong>: The proportion of the GCM simulations
indicating improving/stable suitability (numerator) vs. declining
suitability or remaining unsuitable.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The weights used to calculate Establishment Suitability and
Maturation Suitability can be modified using the “Adjust Parameters”
dialog box in the “Select Sites” tab.</p>
<div id="novel-climates" class="section level4">
<h4>Novel climates</h4>
<p>Climatic novelty refers to the degree of mismatch between a future
climate condition and the biogeoclimatic analog it is classified as.
Valid inferences of species suitability are not possible in highly novel
climates. By default, biogeoclimatic projections with high (5<span class="math inline"><em>σ</em></span>) novelty are removed from CCISS
results and replaced with a black bar in the detailed suitability
results. Removal of novel climates can be disabled or adjusted using the
“Adjust Parameters” dialog box in the “Select Sites” tab. See
Documentation - Methods - Novel Climates for more details.</p>

<div id="summary-report" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary report</h3>
<p>This report compares CCISS maturation suitability with the Chief
Forester’s Reference Guide for Stocking Standards. Species codes are
coloured according to trends in their future suitability using the
legend at the bottom of the selection pane: improving (green), or
decreasing (red). Species added to the CCISS projected stocking
standard* are coloured purple, and species dropped from the CCISS
projected stocking standard<em> are strike-through. </em>Note: These are
not formally adopted stocking standards by BC Ministry of Forests.</p>
