### Known issues with the CCISS tool

Understanding potential sources of error is essential for appropriate
use of the CCISS tool. The CCISS methodology has many components such as
the species suitability ratings, climate mapping, biogeoclimatic

Each of these components have their own degree of error that can carry
through into the CCISS tool results, emphasizing the importance of
professional scrutiny in the interpretation of these results.
