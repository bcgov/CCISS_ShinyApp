### Known issues with the CCISS tool

This section is focused on aspects of the CCISS analysis related to trade-offs and intrinsic sources of error. We also list bugs or minor enhancements that have not yet been resolved. If you have an problem or suggestion to report, you can enter it as a "New issue" in our <a href="https://github.com/bcgov/CCISS_ShinyApp/issues" target="_blank">GitHub repo </a>. 


#### Issues requiring fixing

- The CCISS tool should only take about 10 seconds to load at startup. However, it has recently been taking up to 50 seconds. We are investigating this issue. 
- The CCISS tool is currently missing CFRG species suitability ratings ("Suitability" tab) and silvics information ("Silvics" tab) for coastal subzone/variants, this is associated with updating to the new coastal BEC version (BEC13). We will update this information using a crosswalk table from BEC v12 coastal site series (LMH 26 & 28) to BEC v13 (LHM77) asap.
