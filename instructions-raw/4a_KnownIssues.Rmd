### Known issues with the CCISS tool

This section is focused on aspects of the CCISS analysis related to trade-offs and intrinsic sources of error. We also list bugs or minor enhancements that have not yet been resolved. if you have an problem or suggestion to report, you can enter it as a "New issue" in our [GitHub repo}(https://github.com/bcgov/CCISS_ShinyApp/issues). 


#### Issues requiring fixing

- The CCISS tool should only take about 10 seconds to load at startup. However, it has recently been taking up to 50 seconds. We are investigating this issue. 
- There currently are no site series names for most of the coastal subzone/variants. This is associated with updating to the new coastal BEC version (BEC13). As a result, the **Silvics** tab does not return results for coastal units. We will resolve this asap.
