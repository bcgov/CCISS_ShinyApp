<h3>Feasibility (Environmental Suitability) Ratings</h3>
<p>CCISS estimates historical (1961-1990) tree species suitability
ratings for all site series in British Columbia to reflect only the
feasibility of species for reforestation based on species prominence in
natural stands, observed plantation success, and autecological
characteristics. Site-level variation in species feasibility within each
biogeoclimatic unit for Alberta and the USA was similarly approximated
using the plot data located in the modelled climate areas, descriptions
available in publications describing forest associations or ecosites,
and available autecological interpretations. We define reforestation
feasibility using five categories:</p>
<p><strong>E1 – High environmental suitability</strong>: Typically, no
environmental limiting conditions for establishment and growth across
the full range of site series conditions.</p>
<p><strong>E2 – Moderate environmental suitability</strong>: Once tree
species are successfully established, they will generally perform well.
However;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>species may be more susceptible to occasional but expected
climatic extremes leading to mortality, damage, or reduced growth
(e.g. drought periods);</p></li>
<li><p>some site types of the site series conditions may have higher
constraints for the species leading to poor regeneration success or
subsequent growth (e.g. frost prone locations or overly wet sites in Sx
– Horsetail site series),</p></li>
<li><p>may express slow growth rates across all conditions
(e.g. woodland subzones or Xeric sites with ~SI50 &lt; 8m)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>E3 – Low environmental suitability</strong>: Establishment
and growth may be limited to specific site conditions of the site series
but may perform well where successfully established.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>expected climatic extremes have a high probability of causing
reduced growth, damage or mortality in some years (e.g. drought
periods);</p></li>
<li><p>a limited set of site series conditions are considered feasible
for the species though it may perform well under these constraints
(e.g. only feasible on warm aspect, lower elevations of the
ESSF);</p></li>
<li><p>species may express very low growth rates across all conditions
(e.g. parkland subzones or rock outcrops with SI50 &lt; 5m)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-local Feasibility</strong>: Off-site trials indicate that
a non-local species was feasible in the pre-climate change period but
that migration lag or some other barrier restricted establishment.</p>
<p><strong>Trial</strong>: Species is not recognized as historically
feasible for a site series but is projected to become feasible in the
near future. Establishment of small operational trials recommended to
provide information on possible inclusion of species in feasible species
list.</p>
<p><strong>Unsuitable</strong>: Unlisted species are considered to be
unsuitable to the site series in current and future periods. Future
projections may indicate species are becoming unsuitable. This indicates
that the climatic regime may impose serious growth constraints on the
established species but may not necessarily indicate mortality.</p>
<p>Feasibility for different time periods, given the progression of
climate change, are given the following terms in the CCISS tool:</p>
<p><strong>Historic Feasibility</strong>: The baseline environmental
suitability rating based primarily on the CFRG and the historic period
pre 1991.</p>
<p><strong>Establishment Feasibility</strong>: The feasibility rating
based on the mean historic, current, and 2021-2040 future projected
feasibilities. This indicates the likely level of constraints for
successful establishment of the species now.</p>
<p><strong>Maturation Feasibility</strong>: The mean feasibility rating
based on the 4 future modelled 2021-2040 future projected feasibilities.
This indicates the likely level of constraints for successful
establishment of the species now.</p>
<p>Insect and disease risks need to be considered in reforestation,
particularly in the context of climate change. These factors are
currently being assessed by Forest Health researchers. However,
currently forest health factors need to be assessed as an additional
consideration to CCISS feasibility projections.</p>

<h3>Differences from the Chief Forester’s Reference Guide</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/silviculture/stocking-standards">Establishment
to Free Growing Guidebooks</a> and <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/forestry/silviculture/stocking-standards/reference-guide/reference_guide_stocking_standards_20210907.xlsx">Chief
Forester’s Reference Guide for Stocking Standards</a> (CFRG) rank
ecologically acceptable species for each site series. Three criteria are
used to determine the most suitable species choices for sawlog
production (the assumed management goal) based on an assessment of:</p>
<ul>
<li>maximum sustainable productivity</li>
<li>crop reliability</li>
<li>silvicultural feasibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rankings applied always have at least one “primary” species for
each site series indicating the best species choice to meet the timber
objective.</p>
<p>In contrast, the CCISS tool assesses the environmental suitability
rating to species, which focuses on how well the species is suited to
the climatic and site conditions of a site series regardless of
management objective. Each tree species has adapted to a specific range
of environmental conditions, and its growth and behaviour depend on the
ecosystem in which it grows. In an unfavourable environment, that
species growth potential will not be realized, and its susceptibility to
damaging agents will increase. Unlike the ratings applied in the CFRG,
site series with generally challenging growing conditions may have no
tree species assigned to the highest suitability rating.</p>
