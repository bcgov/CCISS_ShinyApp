### CCISS Expert Review

#### As of March 2025

Given the complexity of forest ecosystems and climate change impacts on
tree species, it is essential that the CCISS tool undergoes evaluation
by experts. The BC Ministry of Forest (FOR) Ecologists have conducted an
initial review of the following aspects of the CCISS tool (outlined
below). We are engaging with additional subject matter experts to
provide a review, including silviculturists, forest health specialists,
and tree breeders.

#### 1. Tree Species Environmental Suitability Definitions

FOR Ecologists have provided feedback on the supporting documentation
and definitions of Tree Species Environmental Suitability ratings. An
in-person meeting with the Provincial Ecology team to review CCISS model
results and the historical species suitability ratings took place in
November 2024. Per request of the Ecology team, the CCISS team developed
new documentation outlining definitions and a multi-step rating process
for species environmental suitability ratings, which we presented back
to the Ecology team in December 2024. The CCISS team incorporated two
rounds of revision to the Species Environmental Suitability ratings
documentation resulting in a final version as of February 2025.

See the "Methods - Suitability Ratings" tab for more information.

#### 2. Tree Species Environmental Suitability Ratings

FOR Ecologists are reviewing the existing environmental suitability
ratings in their region. The objective of this review is to refine the
suitability ratings using expert knowledge and available information
sources, assist with filling in gaps if any, and to document known issues
for further follow-up. The resulting suitability ratings will provide a
strong scientific foundation and provide a consistent baseline for
further refinement using quantitative methods. Using the updated
documentation and rating process outlined above, Ecologists began
reviewing species suitability ratings in February 2025. This review is
complete for the Coast Area, Omenica, Cariboo, and Thompson-Okanagan
Regions.

#### 3. CCISS Tool Results

FOR Ecologists are core subject matter experts for CCISS and we have
engaged this group to perform an initial review of CCISS tool results.
The Ecologist review will provide insight into the CCISS toolâ€™s
ecological accuracy and alignment with current ecological knowledge,
help identify issues, and inform readiness for broader implementation.
An in-person meeting with the Provincial Ecology team to review CCISS
model results and the historical species suitability ratings took place
in November 2024. All Ecology team members created GitHub accounts and
began documenting issues they identified with CCISS model results via
Github issues. In addition to feedback provided through GitHub, we held
individual meetings for each Forest Region to gather an initial round
feedback in March 2025. This review is ongoing and iterative as we
incorporate updates to the inputs (e.g., suitability ratings) and models
(e.g., BGC model).

#### 4. CCISS Tool Layout and Documentation

FOR Ecologists have also provided feedback on the layout of the CCISS
tool, information presentation, and supporting documentation.
