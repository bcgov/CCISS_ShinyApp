### CCISS Expert Review

#### As of April 2025

Given the complexity of forest ecosystems and climate change impacts on
tree species, it is essential that the CCISS tool undergoes evaluation
by experts. In 2024-24 the BC Ministry of Forest (FOR) Ecologists
conducted a review of the following aspects of the CCISS tool (outlined
below). We are engaging with additional subject matter experts to
provide a review, including silviculturists, forest health specialists,
and tree breeders.

#### 1. Tree Species Environmental Suitability Ratings

The initial environmental suitability ratings were assigned in 2017 by
A. Banner (Coast and North Area), T. Braumandl (Kootenay-Boundary and
Thompson-Okanagan), W. MacKenzie (Alberta), and D. Meidinger (USA). A
subsequent review of this output in 2018-2019 led to some clarification
of definitions and modifications of initial ratings. The initial ratings
were reviewed in 2021 by regional experts, see Rating of Tree Species
Environmental Suitability Technical Report (2025) for a full overview of
the suitability process to date. FOR Ecologists reviewed the existing
environmental suitability ratings in their region. The objective of this
review was to refine the suitability ratings using expert knowledge and
available information sources, assist with filling in gaps if any, and
to document known issues for further follow-up. The resulting
suitability ratings provide a strong scientific foundation and provide a
consistent baseline for further refinement using quantitative methods.
Using the updated documentation and rating process outlined above,
Ecologists began reviewing species suitability ratings in February 2025.
This review is complete for the Coast Area, Omenica, Cariboo, and
Thompson-Okanagan Regions.

#### 2. Tree Species Environmental Suitability Definitions

FOR Ecologists have provided feedback on the supporting documentation
and definitions of Tree Species Environmental Suitability ratings. An
in-person meeting with the FOR Ecology team to review CCISS model
results and the historical species suitability ratings took place in
November 2024. Per request of the Ecology team, the CCISS team developed
new documentation outlining definitions and a multi-step rating process
for species environmental suitability ratings, which we presented back
to the Ecology team in December 2024. The CCISS team incorporated two
rounds of revision to the Species Environmental Suitability ratings
documentation resulting in a final version as of February 2025.

See the "Methods - Suitability Ratings" tab for more information.

#### 3. CCISS Tool Results

FOR Ecologists are core subject matter experts for CCISS and we have
engaged this group to perform an initial review of CCISS tool results.
The Ecologist review will provide insight into the CCISS toolâ€™s
ecological accuracy and alignment with current ecological knowledge,
help identify issues, and inform readiness for broader implementation.
An in-person meeting with the Provincial Ecology team to review CCISS
model results and the historical species suitability ratings took place
in November 2024. All Ecology team members have used and interacted with
the CCISS tool, documenting issues they identified with CCISS model
results via Github issues. In addition to feedback provided through
GitHub, we held individual meetings for each Forest Region to gather an
initial round feedback in March 2025. This review is ongoing and
iterative as we incorporate updates to the inputs (e.g., suitability
ratings) and models (e.g., BGC model).

#### 4. CCISS Tool Layout and Documentation

FOR Ecologists have also provided feedback on aspects of the layout of
the CCISS tool, information presentation, and supporting documentation.
