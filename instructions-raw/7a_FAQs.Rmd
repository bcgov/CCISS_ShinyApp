### Frequently Asked Questions

#### If the climate model ensemble mean is different than the historical climate, does this mean the climate models are wrong?

The historical climate is one observation of many possible climate
states that could have occurred due to the internal variability
(weather) of the Earth’s climate system. Differences between the
ensemble mean projection and the observed climate are not necessarily a
contradiction; like climate vs. weather, the ensemble mean is the
expectation and the observed climate is what actually happened.

However, if the observed climate is completely outside the range of the
individual model runs, this is a problem. There are two major reasons
why this could occur: (1) the downscaled model ensemble is failing to
capture some aspect of regional climate dynamics; or (2) the
observations themselves are biased due to errors in the station
observations or in the gridded interpolation between stations. Both of
these potential sources of error are an active area of research by the
CCISS team.

#### Does the CCISS tool account for forest health factors?

No. The role of forest health factors is explicitly excluded from the
CCISS environmental suitability ratings, with the intention that they
are a separate layer of information in reforestation decisions. CCISS is
one modeling methodology that considers climate change implications for
tree species suitability. Ultimately decisions on species selection
should be made using multiple lines of evidence, including insects and
disease.

#### Why does the CCISS model promote or demote certain species?

The species projected suitability ratings are based on environmental
suitability assigned to a BGC subzone-variant. The CCISS model selects
BGCs that match the future climate projections for the point(s) or BGC
of interest. Future species suitability projections are then pulled from
the BGCs projected for that point or area. Go to the “BEC futures” tab
to see the breakdown of which BGCs are projected.

#### What are the climate drivers of species suitability trends?

This functionality does not currently exist in the CCISS tool. We are
planning to include a climate component in CCISS spatial in the future.

#### What do C4, B2 and D6 refer to? And why does SNR come first?

These are soil nutrient regime (SNR)/ soil moisture regime (SMR)
edatopes. SNR is first because a number first value, e.g. 4C, does not
work in R code, we need to have the letter first. We chose these three
edatopes to represent a poor/subxeric (B2), mesic/medium (C4) and
rich/hygric (D6) site type across all BGCs.

#### What is the uncertainty around the current suitability ratings for the modeled US BEC units?

There is no equivalent, published biogeoclimatic ecosystem
classification and mapping for the United States. We used a draft
classification of biogeoclimatic units for Washington, Idaho, Montana,
Oregon, northern California, and northwestern Wyoming to provide
potential future climate analogues for British Columbia (MacKenzie &
Mahony 2021). Site series classification was developed and species
suitability ratings were assigned by an expert ecologist based on veg
plot data.

There is a higher level of uncertainty associated with the US
biogeoclimatic classification. The draft site series classification for
US BGC units is generic and broader (i.e. larger edatopic range) than
BC, consequently there is less specificity on tree species suitability.
Additionally, biogeoclimatic units are at the subzone level, and in some
cases are climatically more diverse than BC units which are at the
subzone-variant level. However, the inclusion of these draft US BGC
units results in much reduced uncertainty compared to their absence. The
analogs for future climate in much of southern BC are located across the
border in the US.

#### What is the difference between a projection and a prediction?

“Projection”, “prediction”, and “forecast” are related terms with
varying usage in ecology and climate science. For the purposes of CCISS
we use the following definitions:

-   **Forecast**—A forecast is an estimate of possible future states of
    a variable of interest. A forecast is not a “crystal ball” of what
    will happen, but a quantification of uncertainty in what could
    happen. Providing forecasts of environmental suitability for tree
    species is the ultimate goal of CCISS. CCISS forecasts are a
    synthesis of many projections of tree species suitability that have
    been carefully selected to provide a meaningful representation of
    uncertainty.

-   **Projection**—A projection is an estimate of the change over time
    in a variable of interest given a specific set of assumptions. CCISS
    provides one projection of tree species suitability for each of
    three simulations of eight global climate models following three
    atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration scenarios. The 2001-2020
    period of these simulations is considered a projection even though
    it occurs in the past.

-   **Prediction**—In CCISS, the term prediction is used exclusively as
    model prediction: the process by which a statistical model estimates
    a response variable (i.e., biogeoclimatic subzone/variant analog)
    based on predictor variables (i.e., climate variables). A model
    prediction can be made for any values of the predictor variables
    regardless of whether they represent past, future, or hypothetical
    conditions. Each biogeoclimatic projection for one 20-year time
    period is a model prediction.

#### Why doesn’t the US BEC match up with BC BEC across the border?

We are currently integrating updated BEC classification and mapping for
BEC13 (coast region – LMH77). With new BEC, we are also updating mapping
of US BEC and are working to align biogeoclimatic mapping across the US
– Canada border.
