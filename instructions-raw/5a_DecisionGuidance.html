<h3>Integrating CCISS results into tree species selection</h3>
<p>CCISS is intended as a foundation for tree species selection
decisions, not a one-stop-shop. CCISS provides a comprehensive base of
BEC-based interpretations (all species for all site series across BC).
However, any tree species selection decision needs to account for other
information, synthesized through professional judgement, including
sources of error (discussed previously), other lines of evidence, and
non-BEC factors.</p>
<div id="other-lines-of-evidence" class="section level4">
<h4>Other lines of evidence</h4>
<p>The current CCISS analysis is a single modeling methodology with
inherent assumptions and sources of error. Ideally, species selection
decisions should be based on multiple lines of observational and
modeling evidence. The CCISS team is collecting observational data
planning to integrate CCISS analysis with other modeling approaches. In
the interim, practitioners are encouraged to integrate the following
information sources into their decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Off-site species performance trials</li>
<li>Forest Drought Assessment Tool</li>
<li>Climate Based Seed Transfer</li>
<li>Professional experience</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="non-bec-factors" class="section level4">
<h4>Non-BEC factors</h4>
<p>CCISS adds a climate change dimension to the tree species
interpretations of the BEC system. This approach accounts for many of
the climatic and site factors in tree species selection. However, there
are many non-BEC factors that are not directly accounted for in
CCISS:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insects &amp; disease</strong>—the role of forest health
factors is explicitly excluded from the CCISS environmental feasibility
ratings, with the intention that they are a separate layer of
information in reforestation decisions.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Silvicultural systems</strong>—species feasibility for
reforestation is strongly affected by overstorey shade, site
preparation, and microsite selection. In some cases, specialized
silviculture practices will be required to establish trees on novel
sites for which they are likely to be suitable in the future.
Silviculture considerations are to some extent captured in CCISS
implicitly or via footnotes. However, CCISS projections may in many
cases be conservative because they do not account for the role of
silviculture practices in compensating for climate and site
constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Migration lag</strong>—the historical range of tree species
in British Columbia in many cases may be smaller than their potential
range due migration lag following the end of the last glaciation. Since
CCISS feasibility ratings are generally based on natural species ranges,
migration lag is another reason why CCISS projections are likely to
underestimate the assisted range expansion potential of some tree
species.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme weather</strong>—the current CCISS methodology
assumes that changes in the mean climate are representative of changes
in the extremes (the stationarity assumption). This is a reasonable
starting point, and a necessary one since incorporating climate extremes
into the CCISS analysis is non-trivial. However, climate change clearly
violates the stationarity assumption: the 2021 heat dome vividly
illustrates that the distribution of extremes is changing across all
regions. The change in extremes relative to the mean is another
dimension of novelty in the climates of the future, and thus another way
in which spatial climate analogs can under-represent climate changes.
The extent to which the changes in extremes is significant for CCISS
projections is undetermined, but deserves careful consideration during
species selection.</li>
</ul>
