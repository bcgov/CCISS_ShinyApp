## Select points or areas of interest

### **Step 1.** Select points or areas of interest using **one of three methods**:

-   **Option 1**. Click on BGC map to add one or more individual
    locations. Use this option if you have specific sites you are
    interested in or are exploring CCISS results. Where multiple sites
    are selected, the user can choose to generate a report where points
    are averaged within a BGC (default) or for each individual site.

-   **Option 2**. Click on map to choose an entire BGC or a BGC within a
    single Forest District. The CCISS tool will use a set of
    pre-selected random points for the units chosen. This option is to
    be used where general trends are desired by area. The BGC + District
    option is probably most appropriate for stocking standard revisions.

-   **Option 3**. User selects a formatted CSV file to upload
    user-specified and named points. The batch file must be in
    comma-separated (.csv) text format specifying a short sitename,
    latitude, longitude, and (optionally) site series (Formatted like
    ICHmc2/01a with no spaces) for each site. Batch files of up to 4000 points 
    are supported and run at about 20 points/second. 

### **Step 2**. Optionally change to report by individual point or average across all points in the same BGC.

Option 1 and 2 default to BGC averaged reports while option 3 defaults
to individual reports.

### **Step 3**. Click the "Generate Results" at the top of the screen to complete the analysis for the points of interest.

If additional points are added or other changes to parameters the
"Generate Results' button will change to 'Refresh Results" to regenerate
the output.

## Adjust Session Parameters (Optional)

The CCISS tool makes calculations that differentially weight climate
models, scenarios, and time periods in results. We have assigned
recommended weightings for general use of the tool. However, for some
purposes users may wish to adjust the weights given to these parameters
based on their specific objectives.

### 1. Establishment feasibility weights

The Feasibility report provides an assessment of **establishment
feasibility**, representing the likelihood of success in establishing
the species to free growing if planted in the present climate. This
value is a weighted average of the environmental feasibility in the
1961-2020, 2001-2020, and 2021-2040 periods. The default weightings are
even across these periods to reflect three perspectives on feasibility.
First, the 1961-1990 period reflects the proven viability of the species
in the ecosystem. Second, the 2001-2020 period reflects the actual
climate experienced in the location of interest. Third, the 2021=2040
period is the expected climate during the establishment of the species.
Users may want to adjust the establishment feasibility weights based on
whether they want a more historically-oriented or future-oriented
assessment. Note that the feasibility in each of these periods is
visible in the detailed feasibility report.

### 2. Maturation weights

The Feasibility Report provides an assessment of **maturation
feasibility**: the feasibility of the species through the entire future
period to rotation (2021 to 2100). The default setting equally weight
the four 20-year future time periods.

### 3. GCM weights

There are 13 global climate models available in the CCISS tool. However,
the CCISS tool defaults to the 8-model ensemble of global climate models
recommended by [Mahony et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.7566)
and assigns each of these models equal weighting. The five models were
excluded because their warming rates aren't supported by observational
evidence (CanESM5, UKESM1, INM-CM5; explained
[here](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nrs-climate-change/climatena_8modelrationale.pdf)),
because they only have a single run for each scenario (BCC-CSM2,
INM-CM5), or because they exhibit unrealistic localized warming in BC
(IPSL-CM6A).

### 4. Scenario weights

Global climate model projections follow scenarios of future greenhouse
gas emissions called [Shared Socioeconomic
Pathways](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-shared-socioeconomic-pathways-explore-future-climate-change)
(SSPs). The CCISS tool provides the option of giving different weights
to the four major SSP scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and
SSP5-8.5. Collectively, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0 provide a
reasonable representation of optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic
outlooks on global emissions policies and socioeconomic development. The
CCISS tool defaults to equal weighting of these three scenarios to
represent scenario uncertainty in climate change projections. We have
set SSP5-8.5 weighting to 0 in the default scenarios because it is
extremely unlikely based on current trends in energy economics and
policy ([Hausfather and Peters
2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00177-3)).
