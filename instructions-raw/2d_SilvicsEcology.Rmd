## SILVICS & ECOLOGY

This section contains information that may be useful for interpreting CCISS results and making management decisions.

This module summarizes the silvics of each species with historic or future suitability in the selected BGC unit and site series. This information is drawn from Klinka et al. (2000). This information can be explored further at this [link](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/silviculture/tree-species-selection/tool-introduction/tree-species-silvics-and-comparisons).
