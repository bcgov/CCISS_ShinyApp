## Supporting info

This section contains information that may be useful for interpreting CCISS results and making management decisions.

### A. Silvics and Ecology

This module summarizes the silvics of each species with historic or future suitability in the selected BGC unit and site series. This information is drawn from Klinka et al. (1999). This information can be explored further at this [link](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/silviculture/tree-species-selection/tool-introduction/tree-species-silvics-and-comparisons).

### B. Trends

This module provides provincial-scale maps for user-selected species and site types. Three example site series representing different edatopic conditions are currently available: the B2 edatope (nutrient-poor, moisture-subxeric sites), C4 edatope (nutrient-medium, moisture-mesic sites), and D6 edatope (nutrient-rich, moisture-hygric sites).

The figure provides three maps: (left) The historical environmental suitability rating for each species; (center) the proportion of the GCM ensemble projecting the retreat (historically feasible but projected unfeasible) or expansion (historically unfeasible but projected to be feasible) of the species in the 2041--2060 period; and (right) the mean change in suitability across the GCM ensemble by the 2041--2060 period.
