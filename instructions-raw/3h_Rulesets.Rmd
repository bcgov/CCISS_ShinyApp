### CCISS Rulesets

CCISS tries to account for uncertainty in future climates by using a
suite of global climate models (GCMs) and emission scenarios (SSPs).
This strategy usually leads to multiple projected BGCs for each
requested location (as shown in the "BGC Futures" tab) and thus, a range
of projected suitabilities. While it is often informative to observe the
full distribution of projected suitabilities, CCISS also uses rulesets
to "summarise" the projected suitabilities into a single value.

#### CCISS Suitability

For each future period, the raw output of CCISS projections consist of
possible suitability values (1,2,3 or X), and the number of
models/scenario combinations that "vote" for a given suitability. (Note
that due to overlapping edatopic space, there is often not a one-to-one
connection between models and suitability values.) To summarise these
votes into a single "projected suitability", we use the following
equation:

$$
\text{Projected Suitability} = P(1) + 2P(2) + 3P(3) + 5P(X)
$$

where $P(s)$ represents the proportion of votes for suitability $s$ and
$P(1) + P(2) +P(3) + P(X) = 1$. In essence, this is a weighted average
of the suitability values, with slightly higher weight on non-suitable
predictions.

#### Establishment and Maturity

Using the projected suitability described above, CCISS then further
summarises these over multiple time periods into an Establishment
Suitability and a Maturity Suitability. Both of these are calculated as
weighted averages of period-wise suitability: Establishment Suitability
uses 1961-1990 (historic suitability), 2001-2020, and 2021-2040
projected suitabilities, while Maturity uses all future periods (2021 -
2100). The weighting of the different periods are adjustable in "Model
Parameters", and are by default almost equally weighted.

There is one exception to the Establishment Suitability values: if a
species is listed as historically unsuitable, but has a 1,2 or 3
Maturity Suitability, it gets listed as a "Trial" in Establishment
Suitability.

#### Preferred/Acceptable

In order to align with the Chief Forester's Reference Guide, CCISS also
creates a projected Preferred/Acceptable rating, based on
species-specific suitability cutoffs and the Maturity Suitability
(described above). The CCISS tool uses these in the "Summary"
suitability view, as well as in the exported data. For most conifer
species, a primary or secondary suitability translates to $P$, and a
tertiary suitability translates to $A$. There are a few exceptions, such
as **Hm**, which is only assigned $P$ with a primary suitability. With
the exception of Oaks, most broadleaf species are not assigned a $P/A$
value.
