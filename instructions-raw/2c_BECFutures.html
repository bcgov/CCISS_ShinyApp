<h2>Projected BEC futures</h2>
<p>This section summarizes the biogeoclimatic projections that underlie
the species feasibility forecasts. Biogeoclimatic subzone/variants
(a.k.a. BGC units) are the climate component of the Biogeoclimatic
Ecosystem Classification (BEC). Each user-selected location has a mapped
BGC unit representing its historical climate. Biogeoclimatic projections
identify a BGC unit whose historical climate is the best match (best
analog) for the future climate at a user-selected location. In other
words, changes in climatic conditions (temperature, precipitation, etc)
are translated into a change in the BGC unit.</p>
<div id="chart" class="section level3">
<h3>Chart</h3>
<p>The chart mode displays a stacked bar chart showing the ratio of
future BGC analogs by time period predicted across range of global
climate model-scenario climate projections. Hovering over a stacked bar
will display these proportions numerically.</p>
<p>The recent time period (2001-2020) has two bars: one for the observed
climate (measured by weather stations), and one for the modelled
climates (simulated by global climate models). These two aren’t expected
to agree: The modelled climates sample a large range of possible recent
conditions, of which the observed recent climate is only one.</p>
<p>The default mode of this plot simply shows the BGC analog labels.
Specifying a site series of interest will display the site series in the
BGC analog that overlap with the edatopic position of the historic site
series, along with the proportion of the edatopic overlap. The “minimum
site series overlap” slider allows the user to include or exclude site
series with small edatopic overlaps.</p>
</div>
<div id="map" class="section level3">
<h3>Map</h3>
<p>Select the site or area of interest from the drop down menu and then
select a future time period. The map will show the historical BGC unit
in yellow and the projected BGC analogs in grey. Darker greys indicate a
higher proportion of global climate model projections matched that BGC
analog.</p>
