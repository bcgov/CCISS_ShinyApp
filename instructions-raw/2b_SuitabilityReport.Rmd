## SUITABILITY REPORT

In this second tab, users can access the main report of the CCISS tool. The default output is the **Detailed** report, which shows the 
distribution of suitability ratings for the global climate model (GCM) ensemble 
in each time period. The **Summary** provides a comparison of the Chief Forester's Reference Guide (CFRG), the 
environmental suitability rating (expert derived) and the CCISS suitability 
assessment at establishment and maturity.  Users can toggle back and forth between the **Summary** and **Detailed** version using the slider on the left-hand side of the screen, under *Report Type*. 

The concept and definitions of environmental suitability ratings and their 
relationship to stocking standards (according to the CFRG) and CCISS model 
projections are discussed in more detail in the Suitability Ratings section of 
the Methods documentation. 

### Selection/Filter pane

In the left pane, users can select the BGC subzone/variant and then the site series of
interest. The edatopic space of the selected site series is displayed in
the graphic below for reference (see example in Figure 1 and 2 below). By default the report will show all
species that are predicted to be suitable in at least one model and time
period. Users have the option to choose the *Suitable Only* option to limit the list to species
that meet the threshold for classification as suitable across the GCM ensemble 
in any of the time periods. Users can also opt to include outside home range (OHR) species here. For more information on OHR species, visit Documentation - Methods - Outside Home Range.  

### Detailed report

The **Detailed** report shows modelled suitability ratios for each species in the
selected site series for each time period. The colour legend for
suitability ratings is on the left hand pane. The mapped BGC
unit represents the historical equilibrium climate approximated by the
climatic conditions of the 1961-1990 period. The recent time period
(2001-2020) has two bars: one for the observed climate (measured by
weather stations), and one for the climates simulated by the ensemble of
GCMs. These two bars are not necessarily expected to agree: the modelled climates 
sample a large range of possible recent conditions, of which the observed recent 
climate is only one.

The report then summarizes the historical suitability ratings and CCISS
projected suitability ratings for each species in the following order:

1.  The **CFRG suitability** rating: Suitability ratings taken directly
    from the Chief Forester's Reference Guide (CFRG)

2.  The **CFRG P/A** value: Preferred/Acceptable ratings taken directly
    from the CFRG

3.  The **Historical Environmental Suitability**: Expert derived baseline (1961-1990)
    environmental suitability rating for site series.

4.  **CCISS Establishment Suitability**: The suitability rating based on
    the historical environmental suitability (1961-1990), and CCISS projected 
    suitability based on recent observed (2001-2020), and 2021-2040 future 
    projected climates. This indicates the likely level of constraints for 
    successful establishment of the species in the present climate. Default model 
    settings give roughly equal weight to the three time periods, with slightly 
    more weight to the recent (2001+) periods. 

5.  **CCISS Maturation Suitability**: The mean suitability rating projected across
    the four 20-year normal periods (2021-2100). This indicates the inferred
    suitability of successfully growing an established species to maturity (80
    years). Default model settings equally weight all time periods. 

6.  **P/A**: CCISS model assessed Preferred/Acceptable rating based on establishment
    and maturation suitability.

7.  **Trend**: The proportion of the GCM simulations indicating
    improving/stable suitability (numerator) vs. declining suitability
    or remaining unsuitable.

*Reminder:* The weights used to calculate Establishment Suitability and Maturation
Suitability can be modified using the "Adjust Parameters" dialog box in
the "Select Sites" tab.

#### Novel climates

Climatic novelty refers to the degree of mismatch between a future climate condition and the biogeoclimatic analog it is classified as. Valid inferences of species suitability are not possible in highly novel climates. By default, biogeoclimatic projections with high (5$\sigma$) novelty are removed from CCISS results and replaced with a black bar in the detailed suitability results. Removal of novel climates can be disabled or adjusted using the "Adjust Parameters" dialog box in
the "Select Sites" tab. See Documentation - Methods - Novel Climates for more details.  

### Summary report

This report compares CCISS maturation suitability with the Chief
Forester's Reference Guide for Stocking Standards. Species codes are
coloured according to trends in their future suitability using the
legend at the bottom of the selection pane: improving (green), or
decreasing (red). Species added to the CCISS projected stocking standard* are
coloured purple, and species dropped from the CCISS projected stocking standard*
are strike-through.
*Note: These are not formally adopted stocking standards by BC Ministry of Forests. 

## Example: ICHdw1 cont. 

The following example continues from the five points selected previously in the *SELECT SITES* panel of the CCISS tool. Figure 1 shows the top few lines of the **Detailed** report, when the default *Remove highly novel climates* is selected through the dialog box accessed via the **Model Parameters** button, while Figure 2 shows how this report changes when *No Novelty Analysis* is selected instead.

The **Detailed** report gives a wealth of information to the user. In this case, we can see the results for the 1st point (1 / 6530760). The seven-digit number here simply refers to the hex cell that the point is located in. In this example, we have selected the ICHdw1/101 CwFd - Prince's pine - Twinflower site series. We can see from the bars under *Modelled Suitability* that for **Fd** (Douglas-fir), the mapped (historic: 1961-1990) suitability was E1: High. Accordingly, the CFRG gives this species a **1** for *Primary* and a **P** for *Preferred* in this location. The Expert Review on species environmental suitabilities in the historic time period agrees - the experts rated this species an E1 (Documentation - Methods - Expert Review). We see that overall, CCISS gave **Fd** an E1 rating for Establishment Suitability, and an E2: Moderate for Maturity Suitability. 

If we return to the bar chart, under the "Mapped" bar, we see the two bars that represent the recent time period (2001-2020). From this, we can see that the weather station data and the climates simulated by the ensemble of GCMs are in agreement that Fd has generally been a suitable species to plant here in recent times. 

The CCISS tool allows us to evaluate the future environmental suitability of the tree species in the Slocan Valley. We see that in the first of the future periods (2021-2040), there is not much change in the suitability of **Fd**. However, in the next three future periods (2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100), we can see the introduction of novel climates. Note that these are not just novel climates to this region, but climates for which there is no comparable analog in the pool of Western North America historical climates. See Documentation - Methods - Novel Climates for more information. Since the climate in this region is projected to be so different from other analogs in Western North America, we do not know how well Douglas-fir will grow in these conditions, which means there is increased uncertainty around planting it. 

The next species on the list is **Lw** (western larch). The outlook for this species is even more bleak than for **Fd**. As can be seen by the green E1 bar for "Mapped", **Lw** used to be very suitable for the environmental conditions in this BGC unit. The CFRG and Expert Review ratings agree with this. However, the two bars for the recent period (2001-2020) generally agree that it decreased to an E2. CCISS projections suggest that as early as the current (2021-2040) time period, this suitability will drop to an E3. By the end of the century, only 17% of models suggest even an E3 rating for this species, with 42% predicting unsuitable, and the rest falling into a novel climate where we do not know how **Lw** will grow. This information shows us that **Lw** is a highly risky species to plant in the ICHdw1/101.

In Figure 2, we see the impact that including novel climates can have on our results. In this case, we have opted to ignore the 

The modelled suitability ratios show that 92 percent of model "votes" suggested that the suitability of Fd would either improve or stay the same, and 8 percent suggested a decline in suitability.
