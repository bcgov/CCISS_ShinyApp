### Biogeoclimatic modeling

CCISS uses spatial climatic analogs to make inferences about future tree species feasibility. A spatial climate analog is a location with a historical climate that is similar to the current or future projected climate of a different location. Biogeoclimatic subzone/variants are a uniquely useful set of spatial climate analogs because they are the are familiar to resource management practitioners and are the organizing units for site-specific ecological interpretations accumulated over many decades.  

In the CCISS framework, biogeoclimatic analogs are identified by training a statistical or machine learning model to recognize biogeoclimatic subzone-variants in terms of their historical (1961-1990) climatic conditions, and then applying that classification model to new (current or projected) climate conditions (MacKenzie and Mahony 2021). The new climates are thus labelled using their best analog within the BEC system, a process called biogeoclimatic projections (Figure 1).

Figure 1: An example of biogeoclimatic projections for British Columbia, excerpted from Mahony et al. 2021. (a) is the biogeoclimatic mapping for BC; (b) and (c) are biogeoclimatic projections for recent observed climate and a global climate model projection for the 2041-2070 period.  

Although the visual effect of biogeoclimatic projections is of BGC zones and subzone/variants shifting across the map, these spatial shifts should not be taken literally. No analog is perfect, and analogs may be highly imperfect for a number of reasons. The actual future climate at any location will be a hybrid of (1) the characteristics of the analog climate, (2) novel climatic characteristics (e.g., extremes) that are not represented by the analog, and (3) enduring features of the local climate such as frost pooling, lake effects, and wind patterns. The likely proportions of these categories in any location and time period deserve careful consideration by the end users of CCISS products. 

The misinterpretation of biogeoclimatic projections as literal spatial shifts in BGC units has led to a common perception that climate change is rendering biogeoclimatic mapping obsolete. This is not the case. The linework of biogeoclimatic subzone/variants in many cases will remain useful as units of relative climatic variation across landscapes. The terminology we use for biogeoclimatic projections can help to emphasize that biogeoclimatic analogs are only approximations and that the biogeoclimatic units themselves are not undergoing spatial shifts. Rather than saying “this location is becoming IDFxh1”, it is more correct to say “the future climate at this location is predicted to be similar to the historical climate of the IDFxh1.” Rather than “the IDF is moving north into the SBS”, it is better to say “the SBS is transitioning into more IDF-like climates”.
