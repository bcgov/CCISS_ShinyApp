### Biogeoclimatic modeling

CCISS uses spatial climatic analogs to make inferences about future tree species feasibility. A spatial climate analog is a location with a historical climate that is similar to the current or future projected climate of a different location. Biogeoclimatic subzone/variants are a uniquely useful set of spatial climate analogs because they are familiar to resource management practitioners and are the organizing units for site-specific ecological interpretations accumulated over many decades.  

In the CCISS framework, biogeoclimatic analogs are identified by training a statistical or machine learning model to recognize biogeoclimatic subzone-variants in terms of their historical (1961-1990) climatic conditions, and then applying that classification model to new (current or projected) climate conditions. The new climates are thus labelled using their best analog within the BEC system, a process called biogeoclimatic projections.  

#### The CCISS BGC model

CCISS uses a Random Forest machine learning model trained on a balanced set of training points for the BGC units of western North America. The climate predictors in this model are a set of seasonal bioclimate variables selected for low correlation, ecological relevance, and predictive importance. Biogeoclimatic modeling methods are a current focus of the CCISS team and the biogeoclimatic model is expected to evolve over the next year. 

#### Overview of BGC projection trends

Biogeoclimatic projections are illustrated in Figure 1, excerpted from Mackenzie & Mahony (2021). While there is considerable variability in the pace and character of biogeoclimatic projections driven by different climate models, there are some common zone-level trends: the expansion of the IDF analogs northward into the current SBPS zone and into higher elevations in the current MS zone; the expansion of ICH analogs northward into the current SBS zone and into higher elevations in the current ESSF zone; the expansion of CWH analogs into higher elevations in the current MH zone and eastward into the current SBS zone; and the displacement of the current SWB zone by the ESSF analogs. Inter-model differences in precipitation changes are reflected in the biogeoclimatic projections, such as in the expansion of ICH analogs into the central interior in the wetter CanESM2 model instead of IDF analogs in the drier CESM1-CAM5 model. However, the tight relationship between warming and climatic displacement (Figure 1f) suggests that inter-model differences in the rate of displacement of historical climates are primarily driven by the amount and regional pattern of warming. 

The biogeoclimatic projections for the 2011-2040 period include the incursion of exotic biogeoclimatic zone analogs into the province; e.g., the Sub-Boreal Aspen Parkland (SBAP) zone from Southeastern Alberta and the Interior Grand Fir (IGF) zone from Northwestern Oregon. In addition to these exotic biogeoclimatic zones, analogs for the projected future climates of BC also include exotic subzone/variants of familiar zones. The largest area of projected exotic subzone/variant analogs is in the boreal northeast of the province, where Albertan subzone/variants of the BWBS zone dominate. In later periods (2050s and 2080s), exotic analogs are also projected in the major valley systems of southern BC and on the south coast.

Figure 1: An example of biogeoclimatic projections for British Columbia, excerpted from Mackenzie & Mahony (2021). (a) Mapped biogeoclimatic zones, which encompass the 211 biogeoclimatic subzone/variants used to model tree species feasibility. (b) Biogeoclimatic projection of the recent period (1991-2018). (c-e) Biogeoclimatic projections of the 2041-2070 period (RCP4.5) for two GCMs with medium (CESM1-CAM5), low (MRI-CGCM3) and high (CanESM2) regional climate sensitivity. (f) Biogeoclimatic displacement relative to the change in the BC-mean temperature change for each of 90 model projections. Biogeoclimatic displacement is the proportion of grid cells across BC that have a different projected biogeoclimatic unit than their model-predicted biogeoclimatic unit of the 1961-1990 reference period. Boxplots show the full range and 25th-75th percentile range of the temperature change projected by the 15-GCM ensemble in each RCP/time period combination. 

#### Guidance for interpretation of biogeoclimatic projections

Although the visual effect of biogeoclimatic projections is of BGC zones and subzone/variants shifting across the map, these spatial shifts should not be taken literally. No analog is perfect, and analogs may be highly imperfect for a number of reasons. The actual future climate at any location will be a hybrid of (1) the characteristics of the analog climate, (2) novel climatic characteristics (e.g., extremes) that are not represented by the analog, and (3) enduring features of the local climate such as frost pooling, lake effects, and wind patterns. The likely proportions of these categories in any location and time period deserve careful consideration by the end users of CCISS products. 

The misinterpretation of biogeoclimatic projections as literal spatial shifts in BGC units has led to a common perception that climate change is rendering biogeoclimatic mapping obsolete. This is not the case. The linework of biogeoclimatic subzone/variants in many cases will remain useful as units of relative climatic variation across landscapes. The terminology we use for biogeoclimatic projections can help to emphasize that biogeoclimatic analogs are only approximations and that the biogeoclimatic units themselves are not undergoing spatial shifts. Rather than saying “this location is becoming IDFxh1”, it is more correct to say “the future climate at this location is predicted to be similar to the historical climate of the IDFxh1.” Rather than “the IDF is moving north into the SBS”, it is better to say “the SBS is transitioning into more IDF-like climates”.
