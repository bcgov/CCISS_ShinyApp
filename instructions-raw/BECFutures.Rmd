#### Predicted BEC unit futures

Two types of output are presented here.

##### Graphical
Select the Sites and Site series of interest. To remove or see all uncommonly associated site series adjust the minimum site series overlap slider.

The tool will display the ratio of predicted future BGC subzone/variants by time period are presented as stacked bar charts. Hovering over a stacked bar will display the percent of models predicting each BGC.

For the current time period (1991-2020) only, we use the ratio of the most common decision trees in the randomforest. All future time periods are based on the ratio from predicted BGCs from all model/scenarios

Within each BGC segment of the stack bar chart, the ratio of site series that match the edatopic space of the target unit shown.


##### Spatial

Select the site or BGC from the dropdown menu and then select a future time period.
The map will show the target BGC in yellow and the source of future climates are highlighted in grey. Darker greys indicate higher probability.
