<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Climate Change Informed Species Selection
(CCISS) Tool</h1>



<p>Climate Change Informed Species Selection (CCISS – pronounced ‘kiss’)
is a Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification-based analysis framework
built to anticipate the climate change implications to tree species
environmental suitability at a site specific level. The CCISS tool is a
web-based application that makes this analysis accessible to
practitioners to help guide climate change adaptation in reforestation
decisions.</p>
<p>Understanding climate- and site-level species suitability is one of
the foundational pieces of information that practitioners require for
the creation of silvicultural prescriptions that will lead to successful
reforestation over a rotation period. Climate change will affect this
goal by progressively altering environmental conditions and therefore
the suitability of tree species established on a site over time.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, the CCISS tool projects changes to species
environmental suitability at a site series level for any user selected
location in the province and estimates the future suitability of a tree
species to this changing climate. To account for future climate
uncertainty, the tool looks at a wide range of global climate change
models and emissions scenarios to capture the range of plausible climate
futures for any location in BC in 20-year periods out to 2100.</p>
<p>To assist users, the tool compares the current species selection
guidance in the Chief Forester’s Reference Guide (CFRG) with the future
forecast from the CCISS analysis. Reports from the tool highlight where
currently acceptable species are stable/improving or
declining/unsuitable and where new species have become suitable and
could be considered as candidates for assisted migration.</p>
<p>The CCISS tool has been designed to assist professional decisions in
the following contexts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Selecting tree species for individual reforestation
prescriptions</li>
<li>Designing stocking standards for reforestation policy</li>
<li>Setting landscape-level stocking standards to manage risk</li>
<li>Identifying best locations for off-site species reforestation trials
and/or assisted range expansion</li>
<li>Identifying regions and site conditions where forests and tree
species are at highest risk to climate change stresses</li>
<li>Learning about the distribution and ecological tolerances of BC’s
tree species</li>
</ol>
<div id="structure" class="section level3">
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>The CCISS tool is organized into seven tabs.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>SELECT SITES:</strong> User selects points or areas of
interest using one of 3 methods
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Single points</li>
<li>By selected BGCs or BGCs within districts</li>
<li>By submitted CSV file with user site locations</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>SUITABILITY REPORT:</strong> Reports on suitability
projections, presented in detailed or summary form.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><strong>Detailed</strong>: This generates a report showing the
suitability projections for each species for a chosen site series at
each point or area of interest</li>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: This generates a comparison of the Chief
Forester’s Reference Guide stocking standards and the CCISS projected
suitability ratings</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>BEC FUTURES:</strong> The modeled ratio of projected
biogeoclimatic (BGC) units, by time period, presented in two options.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><strong>Chart</strong>: A stacked bar chart that shows the ratio of
BGC units being predicted from the selected global climate models (GCMs)
and climate scenario models in each time period. Optionally, the site
series that are equivalent within each BGC unit can be displayed.</li>
<li><strong>Map</strong>: Show biogeoclimatic map of western North
America with the target BGC unit highlighted and the source BGC units
for a selected future time period shown in greyscale.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>SILVICS &amp; ECOLOGY:</strong> This tab has several subtabs
of tables, all based on Klinka et al. (2000)’s comparison of silvical
characteristics.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><strong>Tolerance</strong>: Comparison of species tolerances</li>
<li><strong>Resistance</strong>: Comparison of species resistance and
potential risk comparisons</li>
<li><strong>Regeneration stage</strong>: Comparison of regeneration
stage characteristics</li>
<li><strong>Maturing stage</strong>: Comparison of maturing stage
characteristics</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>EXPORT</strong>: Exporting reports or data for off-line use
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Produce report: Select report format (html or pdf)</li>
<li>Export data: Select data format (csv or rds)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>CCISS SPATIAL</strong>: Explore maps of CCISS results and
graphical summaries of subregions
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Interactive maps of biogeoclimatic projections, climatic novelty,
and tree species suitability changes</li>
<li>Graphical summaries and spatial data download for subregions (Forest
Districts and Forest Landscape Planning Areas)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>DOCUMENTATION</strong>: Help files and data sources
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><strong>Overview</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>Instructions (How to CCISS)</strong>: Instructions on how to
use the tool</li>
<li><strong>Methods (How the tool works)</strong>: Detailed background
information about what’s happening “under the hood”</li>
