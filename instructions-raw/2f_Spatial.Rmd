## CCISS SPATIAL

The spatial module of the CCISS tool allows users to put CCISS results
into spatial context and explore CCISS data inputs (i.e. BGC model and
species environmental suitability ratings).

Functionality of the CCISS spatial module includes:

-   Maps of biogeoclimatic projections for the GCM ensemble and for five
    representative GCM simulations;
-   Maps of tree species environmental suitability projections for three
    site types (i.e., edatopes);
-   Overlays of climatic novelty for each biogeoclimatic or suitability
    projection;
-   Pop-up interactive plots on user-selected locations ;
-   Interactive plots of biogeoclimatic and suitability changes within
    user-selected subregions;
-   Downloads of spatial data for active map layer at 200m raster
    resolution; and
-   Find-A-BEC for locating specified biogeoclimatic units of Western
    North America.

### Subregion type

The options for Subregion type are `None`, `District` - BC Natural
Resource Districts, and `FLP Area` - Forest Landscape Planning (FLP)
areas. We currently provide functionality for 10 FLP areas; we will add
more as they become publicly available. When a subregion is clicked on
the map, an interactive plot appears to the right of the map. The plot
shows ensemble mean change in biogeoclimatic unit area or species
suitability; variation by GCM can be viewed by clicking the lines on the
map.

### Display BGC or Suitability

Select whether the map displays biogeoclimatic (BGC) units or species
suitability. Subsequent dialogue boxes are customized for each of these
two modes, as described below.

### BGC mode

Select reference period (baseline) historical climate, observed recent
climate (2001-2020), or future climates.

-   When `Reference (1961-1990)` is selected, there is the option of
    selecting between `Mapped or Predicted` view. The `Mapped` BGC units
    are a rasterization of the official linework of BEC version 13.
    `Modelled` represents the BGC unit predicted by the biogeoclimatic
    model used to generate the CCISS projections. The model is trained
    with a sample of locations from each biogeoclimatic unit, and is not
    expected to perfectly reproduce the official linework.

-   When `Observed (2001-2020)` is selected, this displays the BGC units
    selected by the BGC model associated with the observed (recorded)
    climate of 2001-2020. This time period already reflects a slight
    shift in the climate associated with each BGC relative to the
    1961-1990 reference period and therefore the BGC climate analog
    selected by the model.

-   When `Future (GCMs)` is selected, `Select GCM` controls whether the
    map shows ensemble results or individual GCM simulations.
    `SZ_Ensemble` displays the *biogeoclimatic subzone/variant* with the
    highest number of votes across the ensemble of 60 simulations (i.e.,
    the ensemble vote winner); `Zone_Ensemble` shows the *biogeoclimatic
    zone* with the most votes. These may be different because votes for
    the highest-voted subzone variant may be outnumbered by votes for
    multiple subzone/variants from another biogeoclimatic zone. To see
    what the breakdown of votes was for any given location, users can
    click on the map, and a pop-up will appear with stacked bars showing
    the percent of votes for each BGC unit in each time period. For more
    information, see the example at the bottom of this page.
    `Select period` allows the user to select a time period between 2001
    and 2100, split in 20-year increments. Here 2001-2020 represents the
    modeled results of the GCM simulations for that time period (not
    observed climate records).

Regional summaries can be viewed by selecting `District` or `FLP Area`
from the left-hand panel, and clicking on the area of interest on the
map. A box will appear on the right-hand panel of the screen, where
users can adjust the x-variable of interest (time, MAT - Mean Annual
Temperature, MAP - Mean Annual Precipitation, CMD - Climatic Moisture
Deficit , or DD5 - Growing Degree Days above 5°C). Users can also select
whether they want to summarize by zone (or by subzone-variant if
un-checked), and if they want to show the 2001-2020 observed period as
points on the resulting plot.

### Suitability mode

Throughout Suitability mode, there is the option of choosing a
representative edatope (site type) and tree species.

-   `Select Edatope (SNR/SMR)` represents a Soil Nutrient Regime/Soil
    Moisture Regime combination. The dropdown provides the option of B2
    (nutrient-poor, subxeric), C4 (nutrient-medium, mesic), or D6
    (nutrient-rich, hygric). Displaying all 35 edatopes is
    computationally infeasible, so we chose these three edatopes to
    represent distinct, common site types.\
-   `Select species` allows for selection among 15 common native BC tree
    species. Additional species will be added in the future. Codes for
    each species are defined in
    Documentation\>Definitions\>SpeciesCodes.

The mapping of suitability for each time period selected reflects the
underlying BGC unit(s) mapped or projected.

When `Reference (1961-1990)` is selected, this displayed the expert
assigned suitability rating for site series that overlap the selected
edatope. When `Mapped` is selected the mapping of BGC units reflects the
BEC version 13 linework. When `Modelled` is selected the mapping
reflects the BGC units predicted by the biogeoclimatic model used to
generate the CCISS projections. The methods for assigning and
definitions of these ratings are defined in
Documentation\>Methods\>SuitabilityRatings.

When `Observed (2001-2020)` or `Future (GCMs)` is selected, there is the
option of mapping `Projected Suitability` or `Suitability Change`.

-   `Projected Suitability` displays the CCISS environmental suitability
    rating for the selected time period associated with the projected
    BGC units.
-   `Suitability Change` displays the change in suitability relative to
    the mapped reference period (1961-1990) suitability rating,
    increasing (blue), decreasing (red) or no change (grey). Species
    that are projected to become "newly suitable" in areas where they
    were historically unsuitable are mapped in yellow to differentiate
    this suitability range expansion from increases in suitability
    within the historically suitable range of the species (represented
    in blue).

#### Suitability pop-up plot

When a location on the suitability map is clicked, a pop-up is activated
providing interactive 2D plots of the change in biogeoclimatic analogs
and species suitability over time at that location. There may be more
than one suitability rating for individual biogeoclimatic units because
in some cases the selected edatope is shared by two site series with
different suitability ratings (see Documentation\>Methods\>Edatopic
Overlap).

### Display Novelty

In BGC or Suitability mode, the `Display Novelty?` checkbox overlays a
map of estimated climatic novelty. High climatic novelty (\>5σ, red
colors) indicates that the biogeoclimatic subzone/variant identified by
the biogeoclimatic model is a very poor analog for the future climate
condition, even though it is the best (i.e. closest in climatic space)
available. The CCISS tool uses a default dissimilarity threshold of
5-sigma (5σ) to infer a novel climate and exclude the biogeoclimatic
analog. Novelty in the 3-5σ range can be interpreted as a poor analog.
In this range, species suitability inferences may be useful but are also
likely to be somewhat misleading. The methods and interpretation of
climatic novelty are explained in Documentation\>Methods\>Novel
Climates.

#### Novelty pop-up plot

When a location on the novelty map is clicked, a pop-up is activated
providing an interactive 3D plot comparing future climates to the
historical climate of the analog. Click and drag to spin the plot. This
plot is the same for all locations that have the same biogeoclimatic
analog for the selected GCM and time period. Blue dots are the spatial
variation in baseline (1961-1990) climates of the analog. Black dots are
the 1951-1990 interannual climatic variability (ICV) of the BGC analog.
Filled circles (grey-yellow-red) are projected climates of locations in
British Columbia that are assigned the analog by the BGC model, with
colours indicating sigma novelty consistent with the map legend. The
cross symbol represents the 'selected location', the average climate of
the projected future/observed time period selected for the location that
has been clicked (i.e. individual raster cell). The axes of the plot are
principal components (PCs) of analog variation, with PC1 being the axis
with the most variation in the plotted points, and PC3 having the least.
Labelled lines indicate correlations of the input variables with the 3
PCs that comprise the viewspace.

### Hide/Show Layer

This button removes the CCISS layer to reveal the basemap. This is
useful for comparing the CCISS maps to the topography, satellite photo,
or baseline BGC linework. These basemaps can be selected in the top
right-hand corner of the map:

### Find-A-BEC

The `Find-A-BEC` feature helps with locating specified biogeoclimatic
units of Western North America. Select the BGC zone of interest and then
use `Deselect All` to select a subset of subzone/variants within that
zone. Applying the `Gray non-selected BGCs` checkbox assists with
finding the selected unit(s).

### Export data from **CCISS Spatial**:

Data from **CCISS Spatial** are downloadable as raster files. Users can
opt to download data for the whole province by clicking on the gray
**Download Province** button at the bottom of the left-hand panel, or
they can select a specific district or FLP area in the same panel. If
they select a district or FLP area of interest, a pop up appears on the
right-hand side (also where users can view the regional summaries).
Here, users can download the raster file of the map they are currently
viewing.

## Example: ICHdw1 cont.

Throughout the **Instructions**, we have been following an example of
the ICHdw1 in the Slocan Valley of BC. Here, here we see the projected
BGC analogs for this area. In Figure 3, we have selected to display
BGCs, and are opting to look at the future. We selected the
`SZ_Ensemble`, which represents the ensemble vote winner (i.e., BGC
analog with the most votes) in the 2061-2080 time period. When we hover
over the area represented by the black dot, we can see the Layer Info
box that reads **Predicted BGC: CWFdm_OR**. When we click on this spot,
the BGC Projections pop-up appears, which gives a breakdown of the
different BGC units (i.e., subzone/variants) that were predicted by each
of the model runs. We can see that indeed, in the 2061-2080 period, the
CWFdm_OR - Coastal White Fir dry maritime Oregon - has the most votes,
and that it received roughly 50% of votes for that period.

<figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: gray;">

Figure 3: BGC projections - SZ_Ensemble, which displays the
*biogeoclimatic subzone/variant* with the highest number of votes across
the **small** ensemble of simulations (i.e., the ACCESS-ESM1-5,
EC-Earth3, GISS-E2-1-G, MIROC6, and MPI-ESM1-2-HR). At the point of
interest (black dot) added here, the ensemble vote winner (i.e., BGC
unit with the most "votes", is CWFdm_OR).

</figcaption>

</figure>

Next, in Figure 4, we have selected `Zone_Ensemble` from the **Select
GCM** dropdown menu. We can now see the predicted biogeoclimatic zone
rather than subzone/variant. This zone is selected by adding up the
votes for each zone. We can see that it is the CWF - Coastal White Fir -
that has the most votes in the 2061-2080 time period.

*biogeoclimatic zone* with the highest number of votes across the
**small** ensemble of simulations (i.e., the ACCESS-ESM1-5, EC-Earth3,
GISS-E2-1-G, MIROC6, and MPI-ESM1-2-HR). At the point of interest (black
dot) added here, it is the CWF zone.

We can also look at tree species suitability over time, in three
different edatopes. In Figure 5, we remain centered on the Slocan Valley
of British Columbia. In this example, we have now selected to display
`Suitability` rather than `BGC`. We selected the C4 edatope, and **Fd**
(Douglas-fir). For a list of species codes, see
Documentation\>Definitions\>Species Codes.

In this map, we are looking at projected suitabilities for the 2061-2080
time period. The [green]{style="color:darkgreen"} text represents areas
with E1, or high suitability, while [blue]{style="color:blue"}
demonstrates areas with E2, or moderate suitability. The
[yellow]{style="color:yellow"} areas have low suitability, and white
areas are unsuitable for **Fd**.

<figure style="text-align:center;">

<img src="Figure_Instructions_CCISSspatial_suitabilities.png" style="width:55%;"/>

<figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: gray;">

Figure 5: Still centered around the Slocan Valley, this map shows
projected future suitabilities for Fd (Douglas-fir) in the 2061-2080
future period. Green is E1: High, blue is E2: Moderate, yellow is E3:
Low suitability, and white is unsuitable.

</figcaption>

</figure>

We can also look at suitability in a different way. Rather than viewing
the suitability for a species in each time period separately, we can opt
to look at the *change* in suitability over time (selecting
`Suitability Change`). In this map, we see that the suitability ratings
for **Fd** in the C4 edatope in the Slocan Valley are expected to
decrease by the 2061-2080s. These areas of decrease are marked with a
gradient of shades of [red]{style="color:red"}. Meanwhile, higher
elevation areas upward from the valley are projected to increase in
suitability. Areas where suitability is expected to increase are shown
in [blue]{style="color:blue"}. Finally, areas that are becoming newly
suitable are shown in shades of [yellow]{style="color:yellow"}.

historic period (1961-1990) in the Slocan Valley area.

</figure>

In this area, the CCISS tool predicts a lot of novel climates (i.e.,
climates with no good historical analogs). We can see that by clicking
on the `Display Novelty?` checkbox at the bottom of the left-hand panel.
This means that there is much uncertainty about how species will respond
to changes in climate here, because there are no historical areas within
Western North America that have experienced these exact climate
conditions.
