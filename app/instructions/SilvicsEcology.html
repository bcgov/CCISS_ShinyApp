<h5>Selecting points or areas of interest</h5>
<p>Step 0. Report by individual point or average across all points in the same BGC</p>
<p>Step 1. Select points of interest to generate CCISS futures on using one of three methods</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Click BGC map to add locations Use this option if you have specific sites you are interested in. Multiple points can be selected.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose pre-selected points for either an entire BGC or a BGC within a single Forest District. The CCISS tool has a set of pre-selected random points built in for the province. This option is to be used where general trends are desired by area. The BGC + District option is probably most appropriate for stocking standard revisions.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload a .CSV file with locations This option can be selected if a set of sites are already located on the landscape. E.g Planting blocks, Research trial networks.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Step 2. Click the “Generate Button” at the bottom of the screen to complete the analysis for the points of interest</p>
<div id="adjust-parameters" class="section level6">
<h6>Adjust Parameters</h6>
<p>The report uses a set of standard default settings which can be adjusted.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Establishment feasibility rating Default: equal weighting between historic, current, and near future (2021-2040) time periods</p></li>
<li><p>CCISS feasibility rating Default: equal weighting for all future 20-year time periods (2021-2100)</p></li>
<li><p>Global Climate Model weighting Default: 10 GCMs are given full weighting. CanESM5, UKESM1, and INM-CM5 are give no weighting</p></li>
<li><p>Carbon scenario weighting Default: The 450ppm scenario is fully weighted. 260 and 700ppm are slightly downweighted to 80%. The extreme 850ppm scenario is set to 0.</p></li>
